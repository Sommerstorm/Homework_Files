## Example 1
# If you only have one patient to check for this with a false positive frequency of 0.05, then your answer would also be 0.05 for chance of a false positive.
# So technically just barely not statistically significant but what is it actually showing when only comparing one.

## Example 2 
import scipy.stats as st
import numpy as np
N = 10000                   
false_positive_rate = 0.05 
false_negative_rate = 0

# assumming the rate of infection is 0.25:
infected = st.binom.rvs(1, 0.25, size=N)

# number of people infected
number_infected = infected.sum()

# positive test results which is simple because false negative is 0:
positive = np.copy(infected)


# to the false-positive rate given false positive rate is 0.05:
positive[infected==0] = st.binom.rvs(1, false_positive_rate, size=N-number_infected)

# probability that someone with a positive test is infected:
infected_positive = (np.logical_and(infected==1, positive==1).sum())/positive.sum()

#output
print(f'The probaility that someone is infected given a positive test = {infected_positive:.4f}')
